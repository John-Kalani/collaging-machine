# collaging-machine
creates a collage out of jpegs in a specified folder 

It's not currently working perfectly, but it generally prints an irregular collage of up to all the images in the folder (which needs to be exclusively filled with jpegs), the path to which, you need to paste into 'ad' - which is the first thing you should see when you open it!
